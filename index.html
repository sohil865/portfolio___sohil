        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>  I am Sohil Khan, a motivated and detail-oriented IT professional with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications (BCA). Over the past 3 years, I have developed a robust skill set in software development,
            database management, and web development. My technical proficiency includes expertise 
            in programming languages such as Java, Python, and SQL, alongside hands-on experience with 
            web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

           In my previous roles, I have successfully contributed to various projects, 
           ranging from building user-friendly websites to developing efficient backend systems. My strengths lie in problem-solving, analytical 
           thinking, and the ability to work effectively both independently and as part of a team.
           
           I am passionate about leveraging my technical skills to solve real-world problems and am continuously seeking opportunities to learn and
            grow in the ever-evolving field of technology. I am excited about the prospect of bringing my experience and enthusiasm to your esteemed organization.</p>
